# ExamRank02

This repositoy contains the way I resolved the exercises from the second exam of **42 Madrid** programming school.
The subjects of the exercises are from september/october of 2021, so they maybe change a lot when you're seeing this, but I think this is usefull for people who needs to practice.
As I said, here you're going to find only the resolved exercises at my way, so maybe you know best way to do them. If you have some doubt, issue or recommendation, contact me in [Slack](https://42born2code.slack.com/team/U01KDFG5FEX).

You're welcome ✌️
